# TheGreatDtr-Bot
This is a backup of files related to the development of a personalised Discord Bot for a private server, taken from my Repl.it.

## License
Since this is as informal as it gets, this README also contains the basic gist of what I allow you to do with my work.

Feel free to use this for everything, just *credit me* and don't try starting up the same bot on a different environment.
